Memory Game
Memory Game is a simple React application that challenges players to match pairs of cards within a grid. The game tests players' memory skills as they try to remember the locations of various images.

Features
Card Matching: Click on two cards to reveal their images. If the images match, the cards remain face-up. Otherwise, they are flipped back over.
Dynamic Grid: The game board dynamically adjusts to display different numbers of cards based on the provided items array.
